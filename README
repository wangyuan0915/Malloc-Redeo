Your mymalloc and myfree functions should operate in the same way as malloc and free with some exceptions. They will be expected to operate correctly in a multi-threaded program. (You can assume that sbrk is thread safe.) The free function does not return any value, and your myfree function will return a 0 on success, and -1 on failure. It will also print an appropriate error message to stderr. The error conditions are trying to free memory that has not been allocated, freeing memory that has already been freed, and passing a bad address (e.g., NULL or other bad pointers) to myfree
